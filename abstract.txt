ABSTRACT 
Architecture has become a significant part of the path to a technologically advanced future and the 
use of lighting and aesthetics in buildings. It involves the practice of using materials through
processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's 
lifecycle. 
This study explores and evolves methods and techniques, which ensure the broad application of 
lighting and aesthetic principles in five-star hotel and resort designs. It focuses on the identification 
and incorporation of lighting and aesthetic practices within the tropics which has been chosen as 
the study environment. 
The study is meant to create awareness and enlighten hotel developers and users on the advantages 
of lighting and aesthetic principle. It will highlight various benefits of applying lighting and 
aesthetic in hotels and how it can help to minimize energy, improve indoor qualities and wellbeing 
of users at large. 
For vivid illustrations, various Principles, Theories, Strategies, and Application Techniques were 
evaluated and reviewed. Also, various design considerations on hotels were made to ensure proper 
integration of the building with the site and the immediate neighborhood
