Conclusion
All the features above that were analyzed in this study if adopted will reduce the energy use for 
cooling in hotels, improve indoor environmental qualities, and make efficient use of materials and 
proper site management. The study shows that applying lighting and aesthetic strategies in hotel 
design will go a long way in reducing over dependency on mechanical means of lighting and 
ventilation. It will help to improve indoor environmental quality and thereby reduce the percentage 
of â€•Sick Building Syndrome.
To ensure implementation of lighting and aesthetic strategies in hotel design, concerted effort is 
needed by all. Both Nigerian government and the public should be well enlightened. 
Government should institute laws that will guide hotel development in Nigeria. Environmentally 
conscious hotels should be encouraged. Minimum standards that in cooperate lighting and 
aesthetic strategies should be established below which nobody should be licensed to operate. Also, 
seminars and talks on lighting and aesthetics should be organized and aired for professionals in 
the building industry especially the architects.
